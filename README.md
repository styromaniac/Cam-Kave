# Camera-Kave
A PHP-based gallery webapp for photos and videos taken on an Android device.

1. Download the index.php file and move it into the DCIM folder (/storage/emulated/0/DCIM).

2. Find a web server app that supports PHP. I (Styromaniac) personally use [NiM Web Server Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimcomputing.webserver.pro).

3. In your PHP server app, set the document root to /storage/emulated/0/DCIM

4. In that same app, add index.php to Index Pages if it isn't listed already.

5. Start the server.

6. Share the generated link with friends and/or family on the same LAN (local area network)

## Be warned that your photos and videos may end up publicly available on the internet. This is normal behavior for server apps. Do not modify the PHP script to enable uploads without understanding the legal risks.
