# Cam Kave
A PHP-based gallery webapp for photos and videos taken on an Android device.

OpenCamera is required with photos saving to the WebP format. It's highly recommended that "Store location data (Geotagging)" is disabled. It is disabled by default.

There are security fixes in this project, but don't use this on a device containing sensitive data. The author doesn't have any training on PHP security.
