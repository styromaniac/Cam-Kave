# Cam Kave
A PHP-based gallery webapp for photos and videos taken on an Android device.

OpenCamera is required with photos saving to the WebP format. It's highly recommended that "Store location data (Geotagging)" is disabled. It is disabled by default.

## Be warned that your photos and videos may end up publicly available on the internet. This is normal behavior for server apps. If you put robots.txt into the DCIM folder, this will prevent search engines from indexing the webapp on your Android device. Do not modify the PHP script to enable uploads without understanding the legal risks.
