# Cam Kave
A PHP-based gallery webapp for photos and videos taken on an Android device.

1. Download the index.php file and move it into the DCIM folder (/storage/emulated/0/DCIM).

2. Find a web server app that supports PHP. I (Styromaniac) personally use [NiM Web Server Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimcomputing.webserver.pro).

3. In your PHP server app, set the document root to /storage/emulated/0/DCIM

4. In that same app, add index.php to Index Pages if it isn't listed already.

5. Start the server.

6. Share the generated link with friends and/or family on the same LAN (local area network)

Note: If you have an https connection going from your computer either through a reverse proxy or a proper web server setup, you can put KaveTorrent.js into the same directory as index.php or an index.html generated by index.php. This may expose the IP addresses of visitors to other visitors, so beware.

## Be warned that your photos and videos may end up publicly available on the internet. This is normal behavior for server apps. If you put robots.txt into the DCIM folder, this will prevent search engines from indexing the webapp on your Android device. Do not modify the PHP script to enable uploads without understanding the legal risks.
